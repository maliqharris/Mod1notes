    "## Assignment 1: Greeting and String Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Create a program that asks the user for their name and then prints a personalized greeting. The program should also show them the length of their name and display their name in uppercase letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Instructions:**  \n",
    "1. Prompt the user to input their name using the `input()` function.  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Print a greeting message that includes their name, for example:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"! Nice to meet you.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Find out how long the name is by using `len(name)` and print the length:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   length_of_name = len(name)\n",
    "   print(\"Your name has \" + str(length_of_name) + \" characters.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. Print the name in uppercase by using `name.upper()` and show it to the user:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"In uppercase, your name looks like: \" + name.upper())\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Things to Practice:**  \n",
    "- Using `input()` to get user input.  \n",
    "- Using `print()` to display messages.  \n",
    "- Converting data types (e.g., `str(length_of_name)` to print numbers).  \n",
    "- Calling string methods like `.upper()` and using `len()` to find the length.\n",

    "## Assignment 2: Summation of Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Create a program that asks the user for a positive number `n` and then prints the sum of all the numbers from 1 up to `n`. For example, if `n` = 5, the program should print the sum 1+2+3+4+5 = 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Instructions:**  \n",
    "1. Prompt the user to input a positive integer:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   n = int(input(\"Enter a positive integer: \"))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Initialize a variable `total` to 0. This will hold the running sum:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   total = 0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Use a `for` loop or `while` loop to add each number from 1 to `n` to the total:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(1, n+1):\n",
    "       total += i\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. Print the result:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"The sum of numbers from 1 to \" + str(n) + \" is \" + str(total))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Things to Practice:**  \n",
    "- Using `int()` to convert input to an integer.  \n",
    "- Using loops (`for` loops) and the `range()` function.  \n",
    "- Basic arithmetic operations and printing the result.\n",

    "## Assignment 3: Counting Vowels in a String\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Create a program that asks the user for a sentence (or any string of text) and then counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are in that sentence. Print the total number of vowels found.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Instructions:**  \n",
    "1. Prompt the user to enter a sentence:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   sentence = input(\"Enter a sentence: \")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Convert the sentence to lowercase to make checking easier (so that 'A' and 'a' are treated the same):  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   sentence = sentence.lower()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Initialize a counter variable to 0 for counting vowels:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   vowel_count = 0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. Loop through each character in the sentence. For each character, check if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u). If it is, increase the counter by 1:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for char in sentence:\n",
    "       if char in \"aeiou\":\n",
    "           vowel_count += 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. Print the total number of vowels:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"The total number of vowels in your sentence is:\", vowel_count)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Things to Practice:**  \n",
    "- String iteration (looping through each character in a string).  \n",
    "- Using conditionals (`if`) to check if a character is a vowel.  \n",
    "- Summarizing and printing out a final count.\n",

    "\n",
    "**General Tips for All Assignments:**  \n",
    "- Add comments in your code to explain what each part does.  \n",
    "- Test your code with different inputs to ensure it works as expected.  \n",
    "- Donâ€™t worry if you make mistakes; use error messages to guide you to a solution."
